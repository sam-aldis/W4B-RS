# libtui.rs

This file defines a `View` struct that seems to be responsible for managing the layout and display of a text-based user interface (TUI) using the `termimad` crate.

## `View` Struct

The `View` struct holds the following fields:

* `area`: An `Area` object representing the dimensions and position of the view within the terminal.
* `drawable`: A boolean value indicating whether the view has enough space to draw its contents.
* `label_skin`: A `MadSkin` object used for styling labels and headers.
* `text`: A `MadView` object that holds the main text content of the view.
* `input_label_area`: An `Area` object for the input label.
* `input`: An `InputField` object for handling user input.

## Implementations

### `Default`

The `Default` trait is implemented for the `View` struct, providing a default initialization of its fields.

### `View`

The `impl View` block defines the following methods:

* `new(area: Area) -> Self`: Creates a new `View` instance with the given area.
* `resize(&mut self, area: Area) -> bool`: Resizes the view to the given area and updates the layout of its components.
* `apply_timed_event(&mut self, timed_event: TimedEvent) -> bool`: Handles timed events, such as terminal resizing.
* `queue_on<W: Write>(&mut self, w: &mut W) -> anyhow::Result<()>`: Queues the view for drawing on the given writer.
* `update_text<W: Write>(&mut self, txt: String, w: &mut W) -> bool`: Updates the text content of the view.

## Additional Notes

* The code uses the `termimad` crate for creating and managing the TUI layout.
* The `crokey` crate is used for handling key combinations.
* The `anyhow` crate is used for error handling.
